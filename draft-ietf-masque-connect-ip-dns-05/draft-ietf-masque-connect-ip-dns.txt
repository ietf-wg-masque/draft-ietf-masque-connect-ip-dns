          DNS and PREF64 Configuration for Proxying IP in HTTP
                draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip-dns-latest

Abstract

   Proxying IP in HTTP allows building a VPN through HTTP load
   balancers.  However, at the time of writing, that mechanism lacks a
   way to communicate network configuration details such as DNS
   information or IPv6 NAT64 prefixes (PREF64).  In contrast, most
   existing VPN protocols provide mechanisms to exchange such
   configuration information.

   This document defines extensions that convey DNS and PREF64
   configuration using HTTP capsules.  This mechanism supports encrypted
   DNS transports and can be used to inform peers about network
   translation prefixes for IPv6/IPv4 synthesis.

1.  Introduction

   Proxying IP in HTTP ([CONNECT-IP]) allows building a VPN through HTTP
   load balancers.  However, at the time of writing, that mechanism
   lacks a way to communicate network configuration details such as DNS
   information or IPv6 NAT64 prefixes (PREF64).  In contrast, most
   existing VPN protocols provide mechanisms to exchange such
   configuration information (for example [IKEv2] supports discovery of
   DNS servers).

   This document defines extensions that allow CONNECT-IP peers to
   convey DNS and PREF64 configuration information to its peer using
   HTTP capsules ([HTTP-DGRAM]).  These extensions do not define any new
   way to transport DNS queries or responses, but instead enable the
   exchange of DNS resolver configuration and NAT64 prefix information
   inline with CONNECT-IP sessions.

   Note that these extensions are meant for cases where CONNECT-IP
   operates as a Remote Access VPN (see Section 8.1 of [CONNECT-IP]) or
   a Site-to-Site VPN (see Section 8.2 of [CONNECT-IP]), but not for
   cases like IP Flow Forwarding (see Section 8.3 of [CONNECT-IP]).

   For DNS configuration, this specification uses Service Bindings
   ([SVCB]) to exchange information about nameservers, such as which
   encrypted DNS transport is supported.  This allows support for DNS
   over HTTPS ([DoH]), DNS over QUIC ([DoQ]), DNS over TLS ([DoT]),
   unencrypted DNS over UDP port 53 and TCP port 53 ([DNS]), as well as
   potential future DNS transports.  PREF64 configuration is represented
   in a way similar to Router Advertisement option defined in Section 4
   of [PREF64-RA].

   Similar to how Proxying IP in HTTP exchanges IP address configuration
   information (Section 4.7 of [CONNECT-IP]), the mechanism defined in
   this document leverages capsules.  Similarly, these mechanisms are
   bidirectional: either endpoint can send configuration information.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology from [QUIC].  Where this document
   defines protocol types, the definition format uses the notation from
   Section 1.3 of [QUIC].  This specification uses the variable-length
   integer encoding from Section 16 of [QUIC].  Variable-length integer
   values do not need to be encoded in the minimum number of bytes
   necessary.

   In this document, we use the term "nameserver" to refer to a DNS
   recursive resolver as defined in Section 6 of [DNS-TERMS], and the
   term "domain name" is used as defined in Section 2 of [DNS-TERMS].

3.  DNS Configuration Mechanism

   Either endpoint can send DNS configuration information in a
   DNS_ASSIGN capsule.  The capsule format is defined below.

3.1.  Domain Structure

   Domain {
     Domain Length (i),
     Domain Name (..),
   }

                          Figure 1: Domain Format

   Each Domain contains the following fields:

   Domain Length:  Length of the following Domain field, encoded as a
      variable-length integer.

   Domain Name:  Fully Qualified Domain Name in DNS presentation format
      and using an Internationalized Domain Names for Applications
      (IDNA) A-label ([IDNA]).

3.2.  Nameserver Structure

   Nameserver {
     Service Priority (16),
     IPv4 Address Count (i),
     IPv4 Address (32) ...,
     IPv6 Address Count (i),
     IPv6 Address (128) ...,
     Authentication Domain Name (..),
     Service Parameters Length (i),
     Service Parameters (..),
   }

                        Figure 2: Nameserver Format

   Each Nameserver structure contains the following fields:

   Service Priority:  The priority of this attribute compared to other
      nameservers, as specified in Section 2.4.1 of [SVCB].  Since this
      specification relies on using Service Bindings in ServiceMode
      (Section 2.4.3 of [SVCB]), this field MUST NOT be set to 0.

   IPv4 Address Count:  The number of IPv4 Address fields following this
      field.  Encoded as a variable-length integer.

   IPv4 Address:  Sequence of IPv4 Addresses that can be used to reach
      this nameserver.  Encoded in network byte order.

   IPv6 Address Count:  The number of IPv6 Address fields following this
      field.  Encoded as a variable-length integer.

   IPv6 Address:  Sequence of IPv6 Addresses that can be used to reach
      this nameserver.  Encoded in network byte order.

   Authentication Domain Name:  A Domain structure (see Section 3.2)
      representing the domain name of the nameserver.  This MAY be empty
      if the nameserver only supports unencrypted DNS (as traditionally
      sent over UDP port 53 and TCP port 53).

   Service Parameters Length:  Length of the following Service
      Parameters field, encoded as a variable-length integer.

   Service Parameters:  Set of service parameters that apply to this
      nameserver.  Encoded using the wire format specified in
      Section 2.2 of [SVCB].

   Service parameters allow exchanging additional information about the
   nameserver:

   *  The "port" service parameter is used to indicate which port the
      nameserver is reachable on.  If no "port" service parameter is
      included, this indicates that default port numbers should be used.

   *  The "alpn" service parameter is used to indicate which encrypted
      DNS transports are supported by this nameserver.  If the "no-
      default-alpn" service parameter is omitted, that indicates that
      the nameserver supports unencrypted DNS, as is traditionally sent
      over UDP port 53 and TCP port 53.  In that case, the sum of IPv4
      Address Count and IPv6 Address Count MUST be nonzero.  If
      Authentication Domain Name is empty, the "alpn" and "no-default-
      alpn" service parameter MUST be omitted.

   *  The "dohpath" service parameter is used to convey a relative DNS
      over HTTPS URI Template, see Section 5 of [SVCB-DNS].

   *  The service parameters MUST NOT include "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint"
      SvcParams, as they are superseded by the included IP addresses.

3.3.  DNS Configuration Structure

   DNS Configuration {
     Nameserver Count (i),
     Nameserver (..) ...,
     Internal Domain Count (i),
     Internal Domain (..) ...,
     Search Domain Count (i),
     Search Domain (..) ...,
   }

                     Figure 3: DNS Configuration Format

   Each DNS Configuration contains the following fields:

   Nameserver Count:
      The number of Nameserver structures following this field.  Encoded
      as a variable-length integer.

   Nameserver:
      A series of Nameserver structures representing nameservers.

   Internal Domain Count:
      The number of Domain structures following this field.  Encoded as
      a variable-length integer.

   Internal Domain:
      A series of Domain structures representing internal domain names.

   Search Domain Count:
      The number of Domain structures following this field.  Encoded as
      a variable-length integer.

   Search Domain:
      A series of Domain structures representing search domains.

3.4.  DNS_ASSIGN Capsule

   The DNS_ASSIGN capsule (see Section 6 for the value of the capsule
   type) allows an endpoint to send DNS configuration to its peer.

   DNS_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = DNS_ASSIGN,
     Length (i),
     DNS Configuration (..) ...,
   }

                    Figure 4: DNS_ASSIGN Capsule Format

   DNS_ASSIGN capsule MAY include multiple DNS configurations if
   different DNS servers are responsible for separate internal domains.

   If multiple DNS_ASSIGN capsules are sent in one direction, each
   DNS_ASSIGN capsule supersedes prior ones.

3.5.  Handling

   Note that internal domains include subdomains.  In other words, if
   the DNS configuration contains a domain, that indicates that the
   corresponding domain and all of its subdomains can be resolved by the
   nameservers exchanged in the same DNS configuration.  Sending an
   empty string as an internal domain indicates the DNS root; i.e., that
   the corresponding nameserver can resolve all domain names.

   As with other IP Proxying capsules, the receiver can decide whether
   to use or ignore the configuration information.  For example, in the
   consumer VPN scenario, clients will trust the IP proxy and apply
   received DNS configuration, whereas IP proxies will ignore any DNS
   configuration sent by the client.

   If the IP proxy sends a DNS_ASSIGN capsule containing a DNS over
   HTTPS nameserver, then the client can validate whether the IP proxy
   is authoritative for the origin of the URI template.  If this
   validation succeeds, the client SHOULD send its DNS queries to that
   nameserver directly as independent HTTPS requests.  When possible,
   those requests SHOULD be coalesced over the same HTTPS connection.

3.6.  Examples

3.6.1.  Full-Tunnel Consumer VPN

   A full-tunnel consumer VPN hosted at masque.example.org could
   configure the client to use DNS over HTTPS to the IP proxy itself by
   sending the following configuration.

   DNS Configuration = {
     Nameservers = [{
       Service Priority = 1,
       IPv4 Address = [],
       IPv6 Address = [],
       Authentication Domain Name = "masque.example.org",
       Service Parameters = {
         alpn=h2,h3
         dohpath=/dns-query{?dns}
       },
     }],
     Internal Domains = [""],
     Search Domains = [],
   }

                       Figure 5: Full Tunnel Example

3.6.2.  Split-Tunnel Enterprise VPN

   An enterprise switching their preexisting IKEv2/IPsec split-tunnel
   VPN to connect-ip could use the following configuration.

   DNS Configuration = {
     Nameservers = [{
       Service Priority = 1,
       IPv4 Address = [192.0.2.33],
       IPv6 Address = [2001:db8::1],
       Authentication Domain Name = "",
       Service Parameters = {},
     }],
     Internal Domains = ["internal.corp.example"],
     Search Domains = [
       "internal.corp.example",
       "corp.example",
     ],
   }

                       Figure 6: Split Tunnel Example

4.  PREF64 Configuration Mechanism

   This document defines a new capsule type, PREF64, that allows a
   CONNECT-IP peer to communicate the IPv6 NAT64 prefixes to be used for
   IPv6/IPv4 address synthesis.  This information enables an endpoint
   operating in an IPv6-only environment to construct IPv4-reachable
   addresses from IPv6 literals when a NAT64 translator is in use.

4.1.  PREF64 Capsule

   Each PREF64 capsule conveys zero or more NAT64 prefixes.  If multiple
   capsules are sent in the same direction, the most recent one replaces
   any previously advertised prefixes.  Empty PREF64 capsule is used to
   inform that NAT64 prefixes are not available.

   The capsule has the following structure (see Section 6 for the value
   of the capsule type):

   PREF64 Capsule {
     Type (i) = PREF64,
     Length (i),
     NAT64 Prefix (104) ...,
   }

                      Figure 7: PREF64 Capsule Format

   Individual NAT64 prefix has the following structure:

   NAT64 Prefix {
     Prefix Length (8),
     Prefix (96),
   }

                       Figure 8: NAT64 Prefix Format

   NAT64 prefix fields are:

   Prefix Length:  The length of the NAT64 prefix in bits encoded as a
      single byte.  Valid values are 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 96.  These
      lengths correspond to the prefix sizes permitted for the IPv6-to-
      IPv4 address synthesis algorithm described in Section 2.2 of
      [IPv6-TRANSLATOR].

   Prefix:  The highest 96 bits of the IPv6 prefix, encoded in network
      byte order.  Note that this field is always 96 bits long,
      regardless of the value in the Prefix Length field preceding it,
      see Section 2.2 of [IPv6-TRANSLATOR] for details.

4.2.  Handling

   Upon receiving a PREF64 capsule, a peer updates its local NAT64
   configuration for the corresponding CONNECT-IP session.  The newly
   received PREF64 capsule overrides any previously received PREF64
   capsules in the same direction.

   If an endpoint receives a capsule that does not meet one of the
   requirements listed in Section 4.1, or with a length that is not a
   multiple of 13 bytes, it MUST treat it as malformed.  An empty PREF64
   capsule invalidates any previously received NAT64 Prefixes.

4.3.  Example

   A CONNECT-IP peer would use the following capsule to signal a single
   NAT64 prefix of 64:ff9b::/96

PREF64 Capsule {
  Type (i) = PREF64,
  Length (i) = 13,
  NAT64 Prefix {
    Prefix Length (8) = 96
    Prefix (96) = 0x00 0x64 0xff 0x9b 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00,
  }
}

                   Figure 9: PREF64 Capsule Example

5.  Security Considerations

   Acting on received DNS_ASSIGN capsules can have significant impact on
   endpoint security.  Endpoints MUST ignore DNS_ASSIGN capsules unless
   it has reason to trust its peer and is expecting DNS configuration
   from it.

   This mechanism can cause an endpoint to use a nameserver that is
   outside of the connect-ip tunnel.  While this is acceptable in some
   scenarios, in others it could break the privacy properties provided
   by the tunnel.  To avoid this, implementations need to ensure that
   DNS_ASSIGN capsules are not sent before the corresponding
   ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document, if approved, will request IANA add the following
   values to the "HTTP Capsule Types" registry maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/masque>.
